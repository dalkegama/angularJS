# srilankan-newsfeed
A live Sri Lankan news feed, built with the power of angular js

A small script I put together to make a live news feed for my mother, who is very keen about her news. Seeing the amount of Sri Lankan news tabs open on her ipad, I thought why not create a page that includes most latest news articles from all the news sites my mom accessed.

The app is built using angularJS and Yahoo pipes.
